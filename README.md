### Dual camera glasses adapter v0 POC

Meant to function as support device to detect, identify and notify about objects, collision, sidewalks, crosswalks, holes, obstructions, faces, doors and they're numbers, street signs, documents and anyother situation deemed necessary.

This adapter will be made using a clip to hold in middle of glasses, similar to sunglasses lenses adapters.
In this clip there will be placed 2x Quelima SQ12 cameras that will connect independently via usb cable to a rpi board.
System maintainned by 20000mah powerbank. 

Use of an external compute unit is meant to not drain the mobile phone battery, far more important than helping with actions a mobile phone is a lifeline.

* Estimated weight on glasses: 32g (excluding cable and pressure that may come from it)
* Estimated External unit: 500g (a bit on the heavier side, this might go down)
